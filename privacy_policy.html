            <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
            <p>We take the security of your personal data seriously and use reasonable measures to protect it from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. These measures include:</p>
            <ul>

            </ul>
            <p>However, no data transmission over the internet is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your data.</p>
